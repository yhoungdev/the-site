          You can now download the official Post UTME Past Questions PDF for All Institutions. All Past Questions you see on this page have been verified by Myschool, and we can guarantee that when you get it from us, it is the true original copy.

          With the rate of fake materials all over the internet, we just had to create this system to make sure we verify all materials before we publish. This means that instead of us (Myschool) to distribute a false Post-UTME material, we would rather not publish the material entirely. You can trust us with that.

        </p>
